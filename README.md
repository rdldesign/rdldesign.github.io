Personal developer website test  

I’m a developer based in the UK. I work to connect business systems using API technolgies for better business insights and to reduce manually intensive work.

I find it really rewarding investigating new technolgies; at the moment I’m looking at voice technology and how this can be used to meet real user needs.

Key technologies

Microsoft Power Platform (with a focus on PowerBI and Power Automate), Python, HTML, CSS, Postman, Alexa, Node.js
