    <h1>Richard Lewis</h1>
    <p>Focused on agile delivery, I'm a developer based in UK. I use service design technquies to understand user needs, working collaboratively to creatively solve often complex business problems.</p>

    <p>I enjoy exploring new technologies and build proof of concepts. for example voice assistants, and how these might be used to solve real world problems.</p>
        
     <p>I also have experience integrating systems using API technologies.</p>
        
     <p>I'm currently working at Lichfield District Council where I'm currently focused on low-code technologies and really pushing these to see what can be achieved. I have a
        background in web development.
