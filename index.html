    <h1>Richard Lewis</h1>
    <p>Focused on agile delivery, I'm a developer based in UK. I use service design technquies to understand user needs, working collaboratively to creatively solve often complex business problems.</p>

    <p>I find it really rewarding investigating new technolgies; at the moment I’m looking at voice technology and how this can be used to meet real user needs.</p>
        
    <p>I also have experience integrating systems using API technologies.</p>
        
    <p>I'm currently working at Lichfield District Council where I'm currently focused on low-code technologies and really pushing these to see what can be achieved. I have a
        background in web development. </p>
